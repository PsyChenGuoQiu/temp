It is also possible to use different datasets (i.e., your own data or additional public datasets) in this step. If using your own data here, it is recommended to load the example data to view the column names in order to match your data to this format. Read in the data files using pandas, then merge the covariate (age & sex) data from each site into a single data frame (named cov). The columns of this covariate data frame represent the predictor variables. Additional columns may be added here, depending on the research question."

        "Next, format and combine the MRI data using the following commands. The example data contains cortical thickness maps estimated by running recon-all from Freesurfer (version 6.0). The dimensionality of the data was reduced by using ROIs from the Desikan-Killiany atlas. Including the Euler number as a covariate is also recommended, as this is a proxy metric for data quality. The [Euler number](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/EulerCharacteristic.html) from each subject's recon-all output folder was extracted into a text file and is merged into the cortical thickness data frame. The Euler number is site-specific, thus, to use the same exclusion threshold across sites it is important to center the site by subtracting the site median from all subjects at a site. Then take the square root and multiply by negative one and exclude any subjects with a square root above 10."

This basis is deliberately chosen to not to be too flexible so that it can only model relatively slowly varying trends. To increase the flexibility of the model you can change the parameterization (e.g., by adding knot points to the B-spline basis or increasing the order of the interpolating polynomial). Note that in the neuroimaging literature, it is more common to use a polynomial basis expansion for this. Piecewise polynomials like B-splines are superior to polynomial basis expansions because they do not introduce a global curvature. For further details on the use of B-splines see [Fraza et al](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34798518/)."

Whilst this generally only has a minor effect on the final model accuracy, it has implications for the interpretation of models and how they are configured.

If (as in this case) the response variables are not standardized (`standardized = False`), then the scaling both covariates and responses will be reflected in the estimated coefficients. Also, under the linear modeling approach employed here, if the coefficients are unstandardized and do not have a zero mean, it is necessary to add an intercept column to the design matrix (this is done above in step 9 (B-spline)).

The evaluation metrics were calculated for the full test set and calculated separately for each scanning site. The metrics were saved out to a csv file. In this step we load the evaluation metrics into a panads data frame and use the describe function to show the range, mean, and standard deviation of each of the evaluation metrics. Table 2 shows how to interpret the ranges/directions of good model fit."
